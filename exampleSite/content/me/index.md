About me and other format of me.

## Me

"Me" is the objective form of the first-person singular pronoun. It is used when the speaker is the recipient of an action or when the speaker is the object of a preposition. For example:
- She gave the book to me.
 -He is talking to me.

## My 

"My" is the possessive form of "Me." It is used to show ownership or possession by the speaker. For example:
- This is my car.
- That is my house.

## Mine

"Mine" is also a possessive form of "Me," but it is used when the speaker wants to emphasize ownership strongly. It often follows a noun or is used alone as a pronoun. For example:
- The blue car is mine.
- Is this book yours or mine?
